// Developer Express Code Central Example:
// How to convert an XtraGrid to an XtraReport at runtime
// 
// This example demonstrates how to dynamically create a report based upon the
// GridControl at runtime. This means that all filtering and sorting conditions
// selected in the grid are also applied in a report. To accomplish this task, it
// is necessary to create a report with all the necessary bands, bind it to a data
// source and adjust all the necessary options.
// 
// You can find sample updates and versions for different programming languages here:
